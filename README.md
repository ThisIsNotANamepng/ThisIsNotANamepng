### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Jack Hagen, I'm currently a computer science and political science student at University of Wisconsin - Eau Claire, where I also do research in Cybersecurity and work as a student system administrator at UWEC's High Performance Computing Center. 

I am specifically interested in the effect of cyber operations between nation states and the combination of cyber operations with traditional intelligence operations.
